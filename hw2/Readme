Design Choices:

I used HTML  and JavaScript  in order to add the desired features in the homework. 
I used JavaScript while doing followings:
* Changing the current page
* Passing information to the next page
* Communicating MongoDB
* Changing dynamically values of elements of HTML

Furthermore, I used HTML CSS in order to change style of the buttons and lists. 

I thought a single collection that is called 'user' would be enough while designing the database structure of MongoDB.
Documents of the collection include following fields: _id, name, wallet, rating, ratingCount, store, order_history.

Fields of user:
_id: is added by default
name: name of the user
wallet: balance of the user
rating: rating of the user
ratingCount: represents how many times the user has been voted.
store: is an array which is includes products that contain several fields such as productName,productPhoto,productPrice,productQuantity.
order_history: is an array which is includes user's orders that contain several fields such as productName,productPhoto,productPrice,productQuantity,sellerName,isRated.

Fields of store:
productName: name of the product which is sold by the user
productPhoto: photo of the product which is sold by the user
productPrice: price of the product which is sold by the user
productQuantity: quantity of the product which is sold by the user

Fields of order_history:
productName: name of the product which is purchased by the user
productPhoto: photo of the product which is purchased by the user
productPrice: price of the product which is purchased by the user
productQuantity: quantity of the product which is purchased by the user
sellerName: seller name of the product which is purchased by the user
isRated: represents the information on whether the order has been voted or not by the user.
